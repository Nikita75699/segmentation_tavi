2025-03-20_15-22-17 - Trial DeepLabV3Plus_efficientnet-b0_1_1 - CUDA out of memory: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 422.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 47.43 GiB of which 175.00 MiB is free. Process 1146623 has 35.62 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 11.62 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 11.26 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 54.23 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
